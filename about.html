<h4>Meet the Artist</h4>
<div class="goals"><img src="images/me2.jpg"></div>
<div class="goalstext"><p>Hi! My name is Emmalee. I am the founder of Bears Corgis Crafts. I started knitting when I was five and crcoheting around the time I was ten. Ever since then I fell in love with the craft. For the longest of time these hobbies were just that, hobbies. Until recently when I decided it was something I truly wanted to pursue as a career. Some fun things to know about me is that I love animals of all kinds. I have two dogs as of right now and hope to have more and possibly a cat one day. I aspire to keep learning and improving my skills. The reason I love what I do is because when I hand off a finished item the joy it brings to others is better than anything else in the world and I hope to continue for as long as I can.</p></div>

<h4>Goals</h4>
<div class="goals"><img src="images/market.jpg"></div>
<div class="goalstext"><p>Some goals I wish to accomplish include doing more small town markets, building up my business, reaching a wider audience, and opening my very own yarn store. I would love to sell and make yarn. I want to help build the crafting community in any way possible.</p></div>
